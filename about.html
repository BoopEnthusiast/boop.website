                <p class="i-am">
                    LitRPG means literature Role Playing Game, which isn't like a pick a path book or a tabletop roleplaying game. It's a sub-genre of progression fantasy, which is a sub-genre of fantasy.<br>
                    First, progression fantasy is a genre where there is some form of progression system. In cultivation novels that would be the essence that they cultivate.<br>
                    In litRPG, that progression system would be an RPG system of some form. Usually it consists of stats and levels, but it's pretty unspecific.<br>
                    <br>
                    A couple good examples of very unique and effective litRPG systems would be Beneath The Dragoneye Moons and He Who Fights With Monsters.<br>
                    Beneath The Dragoneye Moons' system is unique because each person only gets a very limited amount of skills. It works so well for a book series because it really shows who Elaine (the MC) is at any point, she has to use the skills to decide who she wants to be. It's so interesting.<br>
                    He Who Fights With Monsters' system is based around ranks. There's a common turn of phrase in the book: "Tyranny of rank". Essentially each of the 5 ranks is exponentially more powerful than the next, it makes for a really interesting society along with personal growth.<br>
                    <br>If you're a fan of litRPG I'd LOVE to talk.
